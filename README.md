✍️ Development progress: NaN%

⚠️🥲Due to personal reasons and other unexpected circumstances, the development of this system has been suspended indefinitely.

😀 About this system:
• Built on Android 13 for Google Pixel 6
• Goal: a clean, minimal system similar to LineageOS

⚠️⚠️ Please do NOT flash the first alpha version (0.1) on a daily-use phone.
This version is extremely unstable and contains many bugs. ⚠️⚠️

Most of the README is translated using GPT, so there may be many errors.
