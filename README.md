# AetherOS-0.1alpha-Android13-Under-development-
An AOSP-like system based on Pixel phones
✍️ Development progress: 60%

😀 About this system:
• Built on Android 13 for Google Pixel 6
• Goal: a clean, minimal system similar to LineageOS

⚠️⚠️ Please do NOT flash the first alpha version (0.1) on a daily-use phone.
This version is extremely unstable and contains many bugs. ⚠️⚠️

Most of the README is translated using GPT, so there may be many errors.
